                    <h6>H1-B Visa Program</h6>
                    <p>This nonimmigrant classification applies to people who wish to perform services in a specialty
                        occupation or services as a fashion model of distinguished merit or ability.<br>
                        A specialty occupation is one that requires the application of a body of highly specialized
                        knowledge and the attainment of at least a bachelorâ€™s degree or its equivalent.
                        The intent of the H-1B provisions is to help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed
                        business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce by authorizing the
                        temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorized to work in the
                        United States<br>
                        These includes but not limited to fields in <b>biotechnology, chemistry, computing,
                            architecture, engineering, statistics, physical sciences, journalism, medicine and health:
                            doctor, dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, economics, education, research, law, accounting,
                            business specialties, technical writing, theology, and the arts, and requiring
                            the attainment of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent as a minimum.</b><br>
                        Also, the foreign worker must possess at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent and state
                        licensure, if required to practice in that field.
                        H-1B work-authorization is strictly limited to employment by the sponsoring employer.
                        A person in H-1B status must continue to be employed by their employer in order to stay in H-1B
                        status. If the person's employment ends for any reason, the person must
                        leave the United States, unless the person applies for and is granted a change of status or
                        finds another employer compatible with the H-1B status.<br>
